    "body": "A reliable source of information from inside the Soviet space program is the series \"Rockets and People\"(Ракеты и люди) by Chertok(Б.Е.Черток). A free English translation of this series is available at NASA. I don't know what it's like now...\n\nI checked the original Russian text, but there was no mention of Apollo 12. In August 1969, Soviet space officials were engrossed in a project to develop a space station in an incredibly short time. In October, they were reprimanded by the party for the failure of the docking of Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 7. In December, the space station project was officially launched, and Semenov(Ю.П.Семенов) was chosen as the person in charge. This space station, Salyut 1, was launched in April 1971, and three astronauts stayed there and died on the return.\n\nThe one who was blamed at this time was Mishin(В.П.Мишин), who was in charge of the Soyuz spacecraft. Mishin was also in charge of the manned moon landing program. Mishin's moon rockets were a series of failures. During this period, a film on the theme of Soviet space development,\"Taming the Fire\"(Укрощение огня), was made, but the protagonist's successor was not Mishin, but Glushko(В.П.Глушко), a rocket engine engineer who was a strong opponent of Mishin at the time. Since such films were censored by the party, it is clear that the party had already approved Glushko's subsequent deprivation of power from Mishin.\n\nIn May 1974, Mishin was ousted, and TsKBEM, along with its parent research institute NII-88, was merged with Glushko's OKB-456 and reorganized into the NPO Energia.\n\nAt this time, the Soviet Union's manned lunar plan was officially canceled. However, Glushko, who took power in place of Mishin, immediately proposed his own manned lunar landing plan using the newly developed super-large launch vehicle PLA (РЛА), but it was rejected by everyone at the meeting. Glushko thought that his own plan would begin after Mishin's plan ended.\n\n\n\nTechnically speaking, landing on a different celestial body such as the moon's surface is difficult to obtain altitude information using radar. The reflection of electromagnetic waves from an object whose surface is not well known is difficult to interpret, whereas known man-made objects can be trusted as radar reflectors. Landing on a celestial body with reference to known man-made objects is the basis of high-precision celestial landing.",
