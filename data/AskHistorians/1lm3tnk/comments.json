In the UK alone, by the 1850’s almost 1/5th of the entire country had become enclosed land under private ownership… prior to the Great Famine in Ireland, almost 90-95% of the land there was in the possession of British landlords. (https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1653&amp;context=mulr). \n\nThese landlords had some key advantages over small-holding farmers operating at a subsistence level:\n\n1. British landlords retained any and all profits from their harvests, and were only responsible for paying their field/pasture workers for their direct labor. Most of a subsistence level farmer’s harvest is dedicated explicitly for their own family’s consumption, so the opportunity for profit is minimal. \n\n2. Because the landlord’s greatest expense is going to be labor, they are incentivized to reduce the amount of workers required to only what is absolutely needed based on the amount of land needed to cultivate. A subsistence level farmer is almost always going to be limited on the amount of land they can work because their family is only ever going to be so large. No matter how many children you have, a single family will never be able to work anywhere close to as much land as a landlord who can just hire more labor. \n\n3. The landlords possess the capital necessary to reinvest into their productive enterprises to make them more productive and labor-efficient. They can afford to purchase heavier plows, seed drills, and later on phosphate based fertilizers and steam-powered tractors. This means workers can work more land at a faster pace (and creating higher, more consistent yields) than when only working with basic tools and equipment. This also means less workers are needed in general. Subsistence farmers obviously lack any ability to afford these new developments, so they lose out on the rapid increase in productivity that comes with them. \n\nAs subsistence farming was overtaken by the profitability of more commercialized farming, rural populations had to make a decision. Do you stay in the countryside and work someone else’s land for a meagre wage, or do you head for the growing cities and industrial towns and look for employment there?\n\nStaying in the countryside didn’t guarantee consistent employment either. Most workers became day laborers, and the share of agricultural workers in the UK declined precipitously over the course of the 19th-century.

    "body": "This question is ultimately going to be heavily country-specific, but I feel the UK provides an excellent case study as the first nation to experience the rapid shifts of industrialization. \n\nAnytime we discuss mass-migration of any kind, the reasons for such a migration are going to be numerous and varied. In the case of the UK, I would argue that the most impactful factors for urban migration were the enclosure of common lands, the repeal of the *Corn Laws*, and the industrialization and modernization of transportation. \n\nEnclosure was the process through which private landlords/aristocrats could assume individual, private ownership over land that had traditionally been held in common by rural villagers. While not a phenomenon unique to the UK in the late 1700’s to the mid 1800’s, it did became much more institutionalized and formalized a practice around the period of early industrialization. \n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/landscape/overview/enclosingland/\n\nPrivate ownership over agricultural land proved to be immensely profitable for the influential class of landlords that increasingly dominated the countryside, but for rural farmers it quickly grew to become an existential threat. As a rural farmer, you no longer had the right to access or work land that had been enclosed for private ownership… even if you had always worked those fields or grazed those pastures before. With less land available to work, many were forced to find employment elsewhere. \n\nIn order to preserve the new found profitability of enclosed lands, British landlords began advocating for protectionist agricultural policies, most famous of which were the Corn Laws. \n\nThe Corn Laws were a series of tariffs designed to prevent foreign “corn” (from this point forward, I will be using the word “grain”) from undercutting the profits of domestic grain production. Rural British landlords, using the wealth and influence they had gained through enclosure, pressured Parliament to artificially raise the price of imported grain in order to maintain the profitability of their own grain. \n\nhttps://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/the-corn-laws/\n\nGrain, in the form of bread and beer, had traditionally been the primary staple of common people in British society. These tariffs meant that grain prices were artificially kept high to protect domestic production, and as a result public discontent grew. By 1846, public anger had reached a point where the Corn Laws were repealed by Parliament. 90% of the population saw their disposable income rise as a direct result of the now lowered grain prices, while only 10% saw their incomes decrease (due to increased competition with cheap, foreign grain flowing into the country). \n\nThe problem with cheaper grain is that it becomes less sustainable for a rural farmer to make ends meet when the value of their harvest is being undercut by foreign grain. The era of “free trade” that was ushered in made food cheaper, but also meant that small-scale rural farmers could no longer compete in a global market. \n\nThat global market was only able to come about because of the rapid modernization and industrialization of transportation during the first half of the 1800’s. \n\nhttps://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~dbogart/transport_revolution_surveyjan2013.pdf\n\nIn particular, the rapid development of canals, railroads, and port infrastructure both within the UK and her colonies allowed for a much more reliable and efficient system of moving goods and people. To go back to the example of grain, the increased accessibility and ease of transportation Britain now had with the global market meant that grain grown in Russia/Ukraine, Canada, the US, India, and Australia could be shipped home at cheaper prices than grain grown in the country itself. By the 1880’s, the UK was the recipient of over 70% of the US’ total grain exports. \n\nWith a flood of cheaper grain and raw materials coming into the country, rural people had no choice but to move into the growing industries setting-up in the cities. Shepherds who used to supply the wool-based clothiers and textile mills of  the early/pre-industrial UK would find themselves completely displaced in the market by American, and then later Indian, cotton. \n\nWhen the choice is between starving in the countryside, or finding work in the cramped, polluted city… history shows that people will usually choose whichever option keeps them fed.",
