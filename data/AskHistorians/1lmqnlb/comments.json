                        "body": "Ok, this is a different question but I will try to keep it as clear as possible, like many things there are multiple reasons:\n\n1) Time languages drift with time, latin by being older is more prone to variation and yeah, the arabian world remaining a cohesive political identity didn't hurt as you assumed.\n\n2)Latin was already drifting, even before the collapse of the roman empire regional differences (that to us are hard to pick up) were a thing and even if it is hard for us today to notice it.\n\n3) This is something that one of my teacher would always say \" modern languages don't derive from the latin Cicero spoke but from the latin of farmers!\". Those regional differences become even stronger of you think that modern romance languages derive from the \"broken rural latin\" not the \"correct standard latin\".\nIf you go to Italy and you want to say \"Horse\" you are not going to use the word \"equino\" (which derives from the \"standard latin\" equinus) but you are going to use cavallo (which derives from \"rural latin\" caballus).\nGermanic people learned the \"rural latin\" not the \"correct one\" because everyone would speak/talk in that, even monks which were the intellectuals of the time would often make mistakes while trying to write in classical latin. There is an hilarious letter a monastery sent to Charlemagne which he sent back with the correction.\nAlcuin of work was worried about the efficiency of prayers because a lot of priest would held mass/teach prayers with grammatical errors.\nModern romance languages are born out of these mistakes which were regional-based.\n\n4)Germanic languages didn't just disappear, they influenced the \"latin\" spoken in the areas they ruled. Take Italian, a lot of words in italian derive from Germanic words used by the lombards, some examples are \"azzuffare\" \"rubare\" \"sterzare\" which are all derived from germanic roots not latin ones.\nThe fact that most Germanic tribes had their own Germanic dialects, didn't help either",

Those regional differences become even stronger of you think that modern romance languages derive from the &amp;quot;broken rural latin&amp;quot; not the &amp;quot;correct standard latin&amp;quot;.\nIf you go to Italy and you want to say &amp;quot;Horse&amp;quot; you are not going to use the word &amp;quot;equino&amp;quot; (which derives from the &amp;quot;standard latin&amp;quot; equinus) but you are going to use cavallo (which derives from &amp;quot;rural latin&amp;quot; caballus).\nGermanic people learned the &amp;quot;rural latin&amp;quot; not the &amp;quot;correct one&amp;quot; because everyone would speak/talk in that, even monks which were the intellectuals of the time would often make mistakes while trying to write in classical latin. There is an hilarious letter a monastery sent to Charlemagne which he sent back with the correction.\nAlcuin of work was worried about the efficiency of prayers because a lot of priest would held mass/teach prayers with grammatical errors.\nModern romance languages are born out of these mistakes which were regional-based.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)Germanic languages didn&amp;#39;t just disappear, they influenced the &amp;quot;latin&amp;quot; spoken in the areas they ruled. Take Italian, a lot of words in italian derive from Germanic words used by the lombards, some examples are &amp;quot;azzuffare&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rubare&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sterzare&amp;quot; which are all derived from germanic roots not latin ones.\nThe fact that most Germanic tribes had their own Germanic dialects, didn&amp;#39;t help either&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
