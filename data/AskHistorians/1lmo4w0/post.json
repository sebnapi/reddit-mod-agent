I’m writing a fictional story set in the UK in 1993 and would love some help understanding what train transport would have been like at the time—particularly for travel from Surrey (Woking, specifically, but I don't mind merely referencing to the broader area) to London.\n\nWould it have been possible to travel from Surrey to London via train in 1993? If so, how regular were those routes, and what kinds of stations or trains would be involved?\n\nAlso, how would someone have paid for train fare back then? Would they use cash at a booth, a machine, or buy a ticket?\n\nIf anyone can recommend good resources, search terms, or books that cover British rail travel in the early 1990s, I’d be really grateful.
