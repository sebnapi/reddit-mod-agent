Yet, it seems that China never made serious attempts to directly annex and assimilate Korea as a full part of its territory. This contrasts with Japan, which made repeated efforts to invade and eventually colonized Korea in the early 20th century. Even during times of conflict—such as when Japan attempted to invade—China often supported Korea rather than seeking to absorb it.\n\nEven in more recent history, after World War II, China supported the establishment of North Korea instead of trying to directly incorporate it. Given China’s power and influence in the region, why didn’t it pursue annexation, either historically or in the modern era?\n\nSecondly, how did Korea manage to preserve such a unique and independent cultural identity, despite being situated between two dominant powers—China and Japan—for centuries? Korean culture today is clearly distinct, rather than being a blend or offshoot of either neighbor. How did this cultural resilience and differentiation come about?",
