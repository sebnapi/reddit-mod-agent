Yamato people was used in the past (and sometimes still is) to delineate between the predominant modern Japanese ethnicity from the two distinct peoples that hybridized to form it.\n\nIn fact there exists people with higher Jomon DNA than the Yamato, which are the Ainu, the aboriginal people of Hokkaido, as well as the Emishi who used to live in Western Japan before being displaced and subjugated by the Yamato Empire. Thus the delineation between Yamato people and the Emishi people existed since even then.\n\nHowever, the concept of ethnicity didn't exist back then yet.\n\nIn the 19th century, the rise of nationalism began across the globe. Japanese people started to think about what defined them as Japanese. As part of that, Yamato Minzoku 大和民族 (literally Yamato people) was coined by people in Imperial Japan to distinguish themselves as a separate ethnicity. This was used to distinguish themselves from their Asian neighbors, but also the Ainu who were described by anthropologists as being \"caucasoid\" and were theorized to come from outside of Asia (even though we now know they were here before even the Yamato).\n\nIt was used to give unity to the Japanese people, while branding other ethnicities as \"others.\" and thus not subject to the same rights.\n\nEventually, when the Japanese ultranationalism of the 1930s reached it's peak, 大和民族 was used by Imperial Japan for nationalistic purposes and racial theory, and so does have that stigma attached to it.\n\nTo avoid such connotations, nowadays, people prefer to use 日本人 Nihonjin (Japanese people) instead but this is not always useful for all contexts since it does not provide a separation between nationality and ethnicity.\n\nNote however, that Yamato people suffers from the same issues, since Yamato is at the same time an Empire, a culture, a language, etc.\n\nTherefore, academics use the one that contributes to the least confusion in the specific context of the discussion.\n\nAnd as usual, trying to fit the modern notion of ethnicity into a historical context where the concept of ethnicity didn't even exist yet is always fraught with challenges.",

    "body": "There is a bit of nuance in this.\n\nTo preface this, Yamato 大和 in of itself is a valid term that predates Imperialism and is used in all manners of historical contexts without stigma attached. Yamato when used to describe a people, their empire, their language, etc, is valid and perfectly accepted.\n\nHowever, usage of the term \"Yamato people\" (specifically when written as 大和民族) to describe an ethnicity does indeed have stigma related to imperialism, nationalism and racial theory.\n\nThis is also very context dependent. If a modern Japanese person refers to modern Japanese people as \"the Yamato people\", it generally has nationalistic undertones, but not so much in historical contexts. There is a bit of nuance lost in English too because Japan has many ways to say \"Yamato people\" (大和民族, 大和人, 和人) which are all translated as \"Yamato people\" in English.\n\nYamato was the name of Japan for hundreds, if not thousands of years before Imperial Japan even became a thing. Indeed, the concept of Yamato predates the concept of Japan. The ancestors of modern day Japanese people lived in an Empire named Yamato, with the capital being in Yamato (modern day Nara) similarly to how Rome (the city) was the Capital of Rome (the Empire). And thus their people were still the Yamato people.\n\nYamato 大和 (the Great Harmony) was the name of Japan before it was named Japan.  \nOr rather, it was the name they gave themselves while Japan (Land of the Rising Sun) is thought to have been coined in China instead.\n\nIt goes all the way back to the Kingdom of Yamatai, the first ever documented state in Japan, where it is noted in the Chinese Records of Wei (c. 297 CE) that a Queen named Himiko ruled over a Kingdom of Wa, and that in the year 238, they sent an envoy to the court of Wei, upon which Wei declared Himiko as the rightful ruler of Wa.\n\nWhile it isn't known whether Yamatai bears any relation at all to the later Yamato Empire, it was from then on that Japanese people were referred to as Wa.\n\nSince then, the name for the people of Japan had been Wa 倭 or Wakoku 倭国 (Kingdom of Wa).  \nThe Japanese did not have a writing system, so the Chinese picked a character that made the sound of Wa.  \nHowever this character was derogatory and means dwarf or subservient people, so when the Japanese learned how to read and write hundreds of years later, they changed Wa from 倭 to 和, meaning Harmony instead.\n\nThe people of Japan called themselves Wajin 和人 (literally Harmony people) and called their Empire Yamato (大和 - The Great Harmony). The Empire that the Yamato dynasty ruled over for nearly two thousand years and would eventually become both the Empire of Japan and modern Japan, started out as Yamato.\n\n(Part 2 is in the post below, had to separate because post was too long)",
