    "body": "The most often recommended translation of the Bible for academic purposes is the *New Revised Standard Version* and the recent Updated Edition of that version. The newest is the *SBL (Society of Biblical Literature) Study Bible*. The *New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha*, using the NRSV, is pretty comparable. The 1985 *JPS (Jewish Publication Society) Tanakh* is a now-standard translation of the *Masoretic Text* (the definitive version of the scriptures in Hebrew). It is the basis for the *Jewish Study Bible* now in its 2nd edition. The 2006 *NETS (New English Translation) Septuagint* is the closest thing to an academic version of the Greek translations of Hebrew scriptures used by ancient Mediterranean Jews and early Christians (as well as the current Greek Orthodox Church). The *Latin Vulgate*, used by the Roman Catholic Church for most of its history has no recent translations. The *Douay-Rheims Bible* of the late 16th-early 17th centuries, with the 18th century Challoner revisions, was the standard version of the Latin scriptures. There is J.B. Phillips modern English edition of the New Testament from the Vulgate still around. The Catholic Church decided to use Bibles based on the Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic in the 1940s, and the recent iterations of that are the *NABRE (New American Bible Revised Edition)* and the *Revised New Jerusalem Bible*.\n\nHopefully you see the complexity of what you're asking. Different groups, at different times, made versions of Jewish and Christian scriptures which suited their needs. Although they differ in various particulars, the basic texts (in the different languages) were pretty well stable by the 4th-5th centuries CE. The kind of nefarious editing so beloved by conspiracy theorists is not very much in evidence, even though there were changes (usually additions) and mistakes as a result of hand-copying and editing processes over many centuries. \n\nOne thing that may be difficult to accept is that there was no \"original version\" of something called \"a Bible.\" Bibles as we know them are a product of relatively modern times, after the invention of the printing press. Before that, people in general did not have access to Bibles at all. Complete manuscript Bibles, called *pandects*, were very large, expensive (it took a lot of dead animal skins to make one), and rare. Four-gospel books, Psalters, and Pentateuchs were more the norm in terms of size. The first Hebrew versions of the individual biblical books were cobbled together using accretive scribal practices. Scribes gathered sources, edited them together, and adapted them as needed in their specific circumstances. It is unlikely that the priests who came up with the core section of the book of Deuteronomy in the 7th century BCE, knew that in a couple of hundred years, more sections would be added to it, or that it would become the core of a five-book collection known as the *Torah*. It is equally unlikely that the chroniclers and annalists of the kingdoms knew that their records of events and stories would be combined into a grand, propagandistic collection, illustrating God's relationship with his people, or that the scribes who collected proverbs imagined that regular people in future centuries would use them to teach their children, or that those who composed psalms for use at Temple ceremonies knew they would be chanted as a complete collection by monks in centuries to come. \n\nSchmid and Schroter, *The Making of the Bible: From the First Fragments to Sacred Scripture* (2021) is a good, fairly short overview of a centuries-long process.\n\nKarel Van der Toorn, *Scribal Culture and the Making of the Hebrew Bible* (2007); and Sidnie Crawford, *Scribes and Scrolls at Qumran* (2019), can give you some idea about what ancient scribes were up to. \n\nCandida Moss, *God's Ghostwriters: Enslaved Christians and the Making of the Bible* (2024), is a good look at scribes during the Roman Empire.\n\nHarry Gamble, *Books and Readers in the Early Church* (1995) is a classic introduction to early Christian writing and book use.\n\nFor interpretation in the ancient world, James Kugel is your go-to guy:\n\n*The Bible As It Was* (1997), offers an extremely generous selection from primary sources about the many varied ways which ancient Jews and Christians understood scriptures.\n\n*How to Read the Bible* (2007) goes through the Tanakh book by book, commenting on historical, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, and and other considerations in reading the Bible. It's very large.\n\nMark Zvi Brettler, (editor of the *Jewish Study Bible*), *How to Read the Jewish Bible* (2007), takes a shorter, more targeted, approach to learning \"how to read the Bible like a Hebrew.\"\n\nBart Ehrman has both popular and hard-core academic books on Christian adaptations of earlier texts. \n\n*Misquoting Jesus: The Story of Who Changed the Bible and Why* (2005) is the popular version. *The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture: The Effect of Early Christological Controversies on the Text of the NewTestament* (1993, 2011) is the academic version.",
