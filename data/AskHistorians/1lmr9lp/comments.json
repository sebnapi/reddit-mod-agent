    "body": "I’m going to start out with an apology as unfortunately I don’t think I can fully answer your question (at least very well) because it’s such a bit question \n\nAm not sure where you’re getting the notion that a states function was only really foreign policy and defence in the 15th century from. Also these terms are very broad as defence is defence from outside but also inside society (aka involves the police force you mentioned). These terms are unfortunately far too broad to be able to answer your question fully as we need to compare apples with apples and define exactly what we are talking about. \n\nAlso the ability to paint “Europe” as a cohesive, homogenous collection of countries all with the same level of state ‘maturity’ is problematic \n\nFor example, looking at the state structure of a 15th century France (a feudal monarchy shifting to absolute monarchy with heavy church influence and vice versa) vs an elective monarchy like the polish lithuanian state vs an oligarchic city state like the florentine republic, we can see a huge diversity of types of power, legal structure and scope and vehicles for exercising said power.\n\nThese power structures, as well as several factors like the geography of the state (i.e. who their neighbours are, how much they have to militarily defend against them and funnel resources towards this), as well as the religious stance (one of the greatest correlations historically for overall macroeconomic growth / productivity of a nation has been, in Europe whether Protestant or Catholic, with the former often outpacing the latter) and the history of it aka the context in which the state has been formed, are crucial. \n\nThe renaissance happened in Italy for many reasons, with some historians citing factors ranging from the fall of Constantinople and brain drain from there to Italy, to the constant competition between city states, to the economic prosperity of these states, to the political makeup of these states etc, but ultimately it led to “new” (almost nothing is new in human history, just repeated and reframed) paradigms and philosophies being pushed throughout Europe directly and indirectly. The printing press and rise of universities also massively helped the proliferation of ideas throughout different societies \n\nMachiavelli had a huge influence throughout Europe for centuries after his works were written which talked about secularism, economic stability, ways of ruling etc. I recommend reading Utopia, written in the early 16th century by Thomas More. Honestly, it’s like reading a political manifesto turned book from the 19th century where it describes an almost communist society where state controls almost all facets of life (for the “greater good” trope). You will see that he mentions lots of concepts that fall outside of the defence and foreign policy idea you mentioned earlier. Again though a lot of these ideas weren’t new, reading stuff from Plato or Aristotle for example gives us an insight into a lot of these paradigms just in a different context / setting \n\nWhen we get to the 17th and 18th centuries aka the enlightenment it gets super wild with people like Hobbes, Montesquieu, Rousseau and way more really pushing ideas and influencing imperial courts \n\nUltimately though, despite the immense diversity across Europe, there has gradually been less diversity in a political sense. Monarchies have become toothless / figureheads and democracies have been adopted (secularism though is still not universal, in the houses of lords in the UK, representatives of the Church of England can vote). A lot of this has taken place due to these ideas from the renaissance and later enlightenment, with new political models being created that had different ideals / ideas of achieving their goals than typical feudal / absolute monarchists. Typically though when economic growth and stability has been the main objective (as well as staying in power), notions around what the state should or should not do speak for themselves. If you want maximum productivity and economic output, you need to look after your people. Some still argue that healthcare, like in the states, should not be a state responsibility but in Europe it’s quite ubiquitous. If you workforce is sick or dying, it cannot work and productivity falls. What fell into the remit of economic output as a huge equation with multiple variables was widened , first through theory then practice, with economists in the 18th century onwards picking up a lot of the good work of philosophers and political advisors / scientists \n\nBear in mind though that there were still ultimately absolute monarchists in Europe in the 20th century (and dictators still to this day) and a lot of parties constantly argue about how involved the state should be so it’s still not clearly cut and shifts every election cycle \n\nHopefully that helps somewhat!
