While the EIC does absolutely trade in Canton, the majority of what it sells to China is not actually legal…\n\nHow comfortable are you with being an international narcotics smuggler?\n\nThat is not a hypothetical question…\n\nhttps://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/rcs/projects-exhibitions/opium-morally-indefensible-trade-horrible-drug/opium-captions#:~:text=“The%20East%20India%20Company%20secured,or%20godowns%20of%20the%20Company”.\n\nWhile the EIC does not “officially” sell Opium in Canton, as that would be illegal and see them refused all trading rights by the Qing government, it does auction off vast quantities of Opium grown in Bengal and Bihar to “private buyers”. Likely operating from the city and EIC factories of Calcutta (modern day Kolkata), you would need to purchase opium from the EIC and then negotiate passage with a “private merchant” who owns a ship to do business in Canton. \n\nIt is on that ship where you will meet other “private merchants” who have pre-existing connections and business relationships in Canton. The level of enforcement on opium bans can vary, the corruptibility of customs agents depends entirely on who is in charge at the moment, but the product you are arriving with is illegal… so discretion and networking ability are tantamount to your success. \n\nOn your first trip, you will know and understand absolutely nothing… it will be a world unlike anything you would ever have known back home (although to be fair, India is much the same way). Whatever profits you will have made would be entirely the result of other people doing business while you watch. \n\nYou’ll pick-up a few words and phrases, numbers and names are arguably more important though. \n\nBy the second trip, you should absolutely know the words for “opium”, “silver”, and maybe a few measurements for the amounts of opium and silver. \n\nYour ability to learn will be entirely based on your ability to observe and actively listen. Whether it is with fellow European merchants more accustomed to the area than you, or just observing the conversations and words used by locals in the markets. \n\nThe Chinese that you do learn will pretty exclusively be Cantonese, and that would remain the case in the rest of the world until the end of the Chinese Civil War in the 1940’s and the standardization of Mandarin as the official language of China. \n\nUnfortunately, your ability to really access any academic sources to learn Chinese aren’t really going to exist until *after* the Opium Wars end and China is opened up to global trade. Prior to this, unless you are a Portuguese Catholic missionary in Macau, everything would need to be learned through observation and listening.",
