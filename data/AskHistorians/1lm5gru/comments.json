It wasn’t usually a story of independence or quiet cottage-living. It was survival. A single woman without those supports might live in a boarding house or rent a room with strangers or other working women. In cities, she might take in laundry, sew for piecework wages, work in a factory, or take domestic service jobs. None of these offered much stability. If she got sick, lost a job, or aged out of the workforce, she could end up in a workhouse or dependent on local charity. Older unmarried women without support were often labeled spinsters and might rely on the parish or end up in almshouses if they were lucky. If not, they might just disappear from the records altogether.\n\nSex work was also part of this story, though often not framed that way in official records. Women in desperate situations might trade sex for food, housing, or small cash payments. Sometimes it was more formal, sometimes informal or even coerced. It wasn’t always labeled as sex work, but it filled the same economic function for women who had no other means.\n\nAs for the “respectable” options like teaching, nursing, or missionary work, those paths were real, but they weren’t equally available to everyone. Teaching was one of the few professions that started opening to women from modest backgrounds in the 19th century, especially with the rise of public schooling. Still, even so-called normal schools required money, time, and often references. You had to be literate, presentable, and willing to stay single, since many school boards didn’t allow teachers to marry.\n\nNursing became more formalized after figures like Florence Nightingale helped reshape its image. Before that, it was mostly seen as low-status labor, often done by working-class women in poor conditions. When it became more professionalized, it started to attract middle-class women, and training programs had entrance requirements. So again, not entirely closed to poor women, but not wide open either. You needed to be respectable, trustworthy, clean, and usually vouched for.\n\nMissionary work was even more limited. Most missionary societies preferred to send married couples, and when they did send single women, they were almost always from middle-class, devout Christian families. You needed education, impeccable references, and moral discipline. It was one of the few ways a woman might travel or live abroad without a husband, but it was hardly a free life. Expectations were rigid, and your behavior was constantly under scrutiny.\n\nIn short, for a working-class or poor woman without a husband, life wasn’t often full of brave choices and witty retorts. It was about finding food, rent, safety, and work that wouldn’t break you too quickly. Some women made it into teaching or nursing, and a few managed to carve out more independent lives, but most had limited choices and lived within strict constraints. The women who refused marriage often had to accept very real consequences for that decision, especially if they didn’t have a safety net. It wasn’t impossible, but it came at a cost.",

Take for example Anne Lister (1791-1840) of Shibden Hall. She was born into a family of landed gentry in Halifax. In her extremely extensive diaries written from 1817 until her death, she discussed in great detail her love life, including several affairs and romantic relationships with other women. She even considered herself to be married to at least two of these women. In order to prevent a curious contemporary reader from finding out about her love life, she wrote passages containing intimate information in a secret code consisting of mathematical signs and greek letters. The code was cracked in the 1890s by a distant relative of hers and afterwards it was almost forgotten about due to the passages' \"scandalous\" nature and only rediscovered in the 1980s by historian Helena Whitbread. \n\nIn one of those passages from 1821, Anne Lister outs herself as being attracted to women only and justifies why she would never want to be married to a man (\"I love and only love the fairer sex and thus beloved by them in turn, my heart revolts from any love but theirs\"). As to the more explicit parts of the diary about sexual acts, it needs to be noted that there didn't exist any \"official\" terms for some of the things she did with her partners, so she invented her own words for them. For fingering, she used \"grubbling\", for orgasm she used \"kiss\" (as in \"We had a good kiss\") and she referred to her and her lovers' vagina as the \"queer\". Lister apparently wasn't keen on using other devices such as dildos/strap-ons on herself or her partners since she considered thosr unnatural, so she did not use or invent any terms for them.\n\nWhitbread, Helena, editor.

In her extremely extensive diaries written from 1817 until her death, she discussed in great detail her love life, including several affairs and romantic relationships with other women. She even considered herself to be married to at least two of these women. In order to prevent a curious contemporary reader from finding out about her love life, she wrote passages containing intimate information in a secret code consisting of mathematical signs and greek letters. The code was cracked in the 1890s by a distant relative of hers and afterwards it was almost forgotten about due to the passages&amp;#39; &amp;quot;scandalous&amp;quot; nature and only rediscovered in the 1980s by historian Helena Whitbread. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one of those passages from 1821, Anne Lister outs herself as being attracted to women only and justifies why she would never want to be married to a man (&amp;quot;I love and only love the fairer sex and thus beloved by them in turn, my heart revolts from any love but theirs&amp;quot;). As to the more explicit parts of the diary about sexual acts, it needs to be noted that there didn&amp;#39;t exist any &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; terms for some of the things she did with her partners, so she invented her own words for them. For fingering, she used &amp;quot;grubbling&amp;quot;, for orgasm she used &amp;quot;kiss&amp;quot; (as in &amp;quot;We had a good kiss&amp;quot;) and she referred to her and her lovers&amp;#39; vagina as the &amp;quot;queer&amp;quot;. Lister apparently wasn&amp;#39;t keen on using other devices such as dildos/strap-ons on herself or her partners since she considered thosr unnatural, so she did not use or invent any terms for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whitbread, Helena, editor.

    "body": "There have always been women who resisted or avoided marriage, whether because of personal conviction, temperament, economic necessity, or sexual orientation. The idea of a woman choosing not to marry is grounded in historical reality. In places like 19th-century Britain, for example, about 10 to 15 percent of women never married,. Some of these women may have chosen to remain single because they simply did not want to be wives or mothers, while others may have been constrained by demographics, family dynamics, or financial pressures.\n\nAmong upper and middle-class women, avoiding marriage was more socially conspicuous and often carried a degree of stigma. Still, it happened. Some women formed what were known as \"Boston marriages,\" long-term domestic partnerships with other women. These relationships were often described as close friendships or emotional bonds, but many modern historians, drawing on letters and journals, interpret them as romantic or even sexual. Martha Vicinus has written extensively about women in the 19th and early 20th centuries who lived outside of heterosexual norms, sometimes quite openly within their communities.\n\nOne of the more well-known historical examples is the Ladies of Llangollen, Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, two Anglo-Irish women who eloped together in the late 1700s and lived together for over 50 years in Wales. Their relationship was widely known and even visited by famous figures like Wordsworth and the Duke of Wellington. Contemporary society often framed them as harmless eccentrics, but their letters suggest a deeply affectionate bond that would today be understood as a romantic partnership.\n\nModern authors who write historical fiction often draw on these realities, though they sometimes smooth over the difficulties women would have faced. For instance, in novels by Sarah Waters, such as Tipping the Velvet or Fingersmith, unmarried or queer women are central characters, and their struggles with societal norms are a core part of the story. These portrayals are grounded in solid historical research and make a point of showing how social, legal, and economic pressures shaped women’s lives.\n\nWhere historical fiction sometimes drifts into fantasy is in how easily some characters are allowed to opt out of marriage without consequence. In real life, a woman who remained single often needed private wealth, family support, or access to one of the few socially acceptable occupations for women, such as teaching, nursing, or missionary work. If she lacked those, her options were very limited. Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness (1928), while not historical fiction, is a useful example of how even upper-class women who deviated from heterosexual norms could be met with harsh social rejection. The book itself was banned for obscenity in Britain, simply for portraying a lesbian character with dignity and sympathy.\n\nSo the trope of the unmarried, independent woman is based in fact, but how plausible it feels in a given story depends on how well the author accounts for the context. A woman refusing marriage was entirely possible, but not without serious consequences. Some managed to live independently or with female partners, but often at the cost of social acceptance, economic security, or emotional safety. That tension is what makes the trope powerful when done well.\n\n\nSome relevant sources:\n\nStone, Lawrence. The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500–1800.

    "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have always been women who resisted or avoided marriage, whether because of personal conviction, temperament, economic necessity, or sexual orientation. The idea of a woman choosing not to marry is grounded in historical reality. In places like 19th-century Britain, for example, about 10 to 15 percent of women never married,. Some of these women may have chosen to remain single because they simply did not want to be wives or mothers, while others may have been constrained by demographics, family dynamics, or financial pressures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among upper and middle-class women, avoiding marriage was more socially conspicuous and often carried a degree of stigma. Still, it happened. Some women formed what were known as &amp;quot;Boston marriages,&amp;quot; long-term domestic partnerships with other women. These relationships were often described as close friendships or emotional bonds, but many modern historians, drawing on letters and journals, interpret them as romantic or even sexual.
