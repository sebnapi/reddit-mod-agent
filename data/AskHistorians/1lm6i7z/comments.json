              "body": "At its core, the justification for this decision was that it was *for the benefit of* the absentees that they be enjoined. Beforehand, it was understood that only written consent, or before that the presence of a senior officer such as a rector of a parish or a reeve of a village, made such enjoinders for the benefit of the absentees. Now, *anyone* could be acting for the benefit of a group, and so make that entire group parties. \\[4\\]\n\nThis was swept aside in 1737 with *Mayor of York v. Pilkington.* The Mayor sued five people, claiming fishing rights to the River Ouse. All that the defendants had in common was that they had houses on the river. They did *not* think that group litigation was for their benefit. In fact, they expressly argued against that and in favour of being sued individually. The court disagreed, and effectively enjoined five people involuntarily just because they had a shared interest, not because it was for their benefit. This is what we'd now call compulsory enjoinder.\n\nThe key change was in what the court considered a group. Before, the group had to exist before and after the case. Manors, villages, parishes, shareholders and so on would all exist after the case had finished, so group litigation applied to them. Now, the court imagined that a new group was created consisting of the proposed parties, and ignored what would happen afterwards. The reality was that group would dissolve upon the case ending and those people would have nothing to do with each other again (the fact that they all had houses on the river was peripheral). \\[5\\]\n\nSo, by 1789, Chancery could simply make people parties to the case and then issue injunctions applying to them. They could make these groups as wide as they wanted; even a peripheral interest in the case was enough. This is close to what we'd consider universal injunctions today. \n\nIn the common law courts, it was seen that only those who had a direct interest in the specific issues of the case should obtain relief. In Chancery, the idea of \"complete relief\" was prevalent; that everyone who *could* obtain relief, should. This would be achieved through making them parties. The general rule was:\n\n&gt;all persons materially interested, either legally or beneficially, in the subject matter of the suit, are to be made parties to it, either as plaintiffs or as defendants, however numerous they may be, so that there may be a complete decree which shall bind them all. \\[6\\]\n\nSo, in the common law courts, there was the principle of permissive joinder- to be a party to the case you had to apply to the court. In Chancery there was the principle of compulsory joinder- the court would simply make anyone who it thought had an interest to the case, a party. This flexibility meant that the concept of universal injunctions- an injunction against non-parties who still had an interest in the case- did not exist, because there was no need for it to exist.

              "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the justification for this decision was that it was &lt;em&gt;for the benefit of&lt;/em&gt; the absentees that they be enjoined. Beforehand, it was understood that only written consent, or before that the presence of a senior officer such as a rector of a parish or a reeve of a village, made such enjoinders for the benefit of the absentees. Now, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; could be acting for the benefit of a group, and so make that entire group parties. [4]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was swept aside in 1737 with &lt;em&gt;Mayor of York v. Pilkington.&lt;/em&gt; The Mayor sued five people, claiming fishing rights to the River Ouse. All that the defendants had in common was that they had houses on the river. They did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think that group litigation was for their benefit. In fact, they expressly argued against that and in favour of being sued individually. The court disagreed, and effectively enjoined five people involuntarily just because they had a shared interest, not because it was for their benefit. This is what we&amp;#39;d now call compulsory enjoinder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key change was in what the court considered a group. Before, the group had to exist before and after the case. Manors, villages, parishes, shareholders and so on would all exist after the case had finished, so group litigation applied to them. Now, the court imagined that a new group was created consisting of the proposed parties, and ignored what would happen afterwards. The reality was that group would dissolve upon the case ending and those people would have nothing to do with each other again (the fact that they all had houses on the river was peripheral). [5]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, by 1789, Chancery could simply make people parties to the case and then issue injunctions applying to them. They could make these groups as wide as they wanted; even a peripheral interest in the case was enough. This is close to what we&amp;#39;d consider universal injunctions today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the common law courts, it was seen that only those who had a direct interest in the specific issues of the case should obtain relief. In Chancery, the idea of &amp;quot;complete relief&amp;quot; was prevalent; that everyone who &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; obtain relief, should. This would be achieved through making them parties. The general rule was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;all persons materially interested, either legally or beneficially, in the subject matter of the suit, are to be made parties to it, either as plaintiffs or as defendants, however numerous they may be, so that there may be a complete decree which shall bind them all. [6]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in the common law courts, there was the principle of permissive joinder- to be a party to the case you had to apply to the court. In Chancery there was the principle of compulsory joinder- the court would simply make anyone who it thought had an interest to the case, a party. This flexibility meant that the concept of universal injunctions- an injunction against non-parties who still had an interest in the case- did not exist, because there was no need for it to exist. A non-party would simply be made a party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This practice was referenced multiple times in the decision, in both concurring and dissenting opinions, as the &amp;quot;bill of peace&amp;quot;. The bill of peace just means this practice of binding people who do not appear before the court.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

More recent political developments will be left to someone who knows more about that than me.\n\nI will first say that \"universal injunctions\" is a better term than \"national injunctions\". This is not legal pedantry, but important because such injunctions apply to everyone, not every part of the country. The distinction is in who the injunction applies to, not where it applies.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's define \"equitable relief\", which came up a lot in the decision. The law of equity is the set of laws which correct a legal wrong when the common law or statute has no suitable remedy. Most injunctions were issued by the courts of equity, which were a novel invention separate to the common law which prevented or forced someone to do something. So, by design, it is more flexible and adaptable than the common law. Equity law was made solely by the Court of Chancery in England. So, the key question is: in 1789, how did Chancery deal with lots of people who were affected by a case but did not have the means (e.g. financial) to bring their own suit?\n\nFrom the twelfth to the eighteenth century, there were a few ways for group litigation to take place which I won't dwell on (broadly speaking, you could form a corporation, have a few people represent the whole group, or sue as local areas such as a parish, a manor or a village). \\[1\\] This was the same in all fields of law- the common law, ecclesiastical  and equity courts. However, in the late seventeenth century Chancery began to diverge from the rest. There was growing unease in Chancery about group litigation. In 1674, Lord Nottingham created a new rule in Chancery; \"multitude\" of people could be represented by just three, so long as \"they produce before the Register a sufficient authority to enable them to sue in the name of the rest\". \\[2\\] In other words, they had to obtain individual consent before group litigation could commence. This, it may seem, defeats the point of group litigation, since at that point it would be no easier for everyone to sue individually and hire the same lawyer, and one of the reasons that group litigation was created in the first place was because of the logistical difficulties of getting everyone affected to formally agree. This was no coincidence; there was growing distrust in Chancery of the usefulness of group litigation. This is mostly because as villages and parishes (the main users of group litigation) became more connected it was less likely that a proposed litigator was hard to reach- Chancery did not trust the word of the group representatives that they spoke on behalf of everyone.\n\nThe divergence between Chancery and the other courts continued, but the specific procedures in Chancery changed with *Chancey v. May* in 1722. Broadly speaking, some shareholders sued the owners of a company for embezzlement. The owners argued that since only some shareholders had sued, but there were other shareholders with the exact same interest in the case, the owners would be overwhelmed with a multitude of suits from the non-parties once this case was over. The court ruled against the owners, saying:\n\n&gt;Because it was in behalf of themselves and all others the proprietors of the same undertaking, except the defendants, and so all the rest were in effect parties. \\[3\\]\n\nThe really revolutionary part was the part saying that \"all the rest were in effect parties\". Chancery could do this because it dealt with equity and so its remedies were more flexible, but even so this was basically the court ordering others to be made parties solely because they had an interest- those people hadn't been told or wanted to be parties. (They would be parties only in the sense that they were members of a group, but even so this was a stark change from the previous status quo.)",
