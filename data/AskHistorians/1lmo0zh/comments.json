    "body": "The Temple of Saturn was under the charge of one of the quaestors, public officials elected by the Tribal Assembly. That quaestor had the keys to the temple, and Polybius mentions an incident where Scipio Africanus attempted to open the temple against the wishes of the quaestor:\n\n&gt;Once when there was a sum of money required in the Senate for some pressing business, and the quaestor, on the ground of a legal difficulty, refused to open the treasury on that particular day, Scipio said that \"he would take the keys himself and open it; for he was the cause of the treasury being locked at all. \\[1\\]\n\nFrom the rest of the passage we can infer that Scipio was successful- though probably not because he had any legal ground to open the temple; the entire passage describes times when Scipio got what he wanted simply through rallying the public in his favour and reminding everyone that he had saved Rome, essentially. So we can safely assume that, in normal times, only the quaestor had the legal power to open and close the temple, and draw money out of the treasury.\n\nAnother incident involving the *aerarium* was during the dispute between Tiberius Gracchus and Marcus Octavius. Octavius kept on vetoing Gracchus' agrarian reforms, and in response:\n\n&gt;He \\[Gracchus\\] also put his private seal upon the temple of Saturn, in order that the quaestors might not take any money from its treasury or pay any into it \\[...\\] \\[2\\]\n\nWhat was meant by Gracchus putting his seal on the temple is up for debate, but the best hypothesis is that he sealed a gate across the entrance to the *aerarium*. Usually, temples in the provinces that were used as treasuries had the *aerarium* under the *cella*, a small chamber in the middle of the interior of the temple. Not in Rome. The *aerarium* in the Temple of Saturn was likely a chamber in the podium, the raised platform in front of the temple, accessible from the exterior. \\[3\\] So, there was a gate or fence outside of the temple, across the steps leading up to the *pronaos* (the area under the portico, ie between the columns and the interior), that could be closed, although in this case apparently anyone determined enough to shut down the Roman state could do so.\n\nSo, physically, there was a magistrate who held the keys to the temple, and a fence. However, it was no coincidence that public treasuries were held in temples specifically. The plundering of treasures from temples (or, more broadly, anything dedicated to the gods) was considered sacrilege (in the literal sense of the word- *sacer*, \"to steal\", and *legere*, \"to take out\"). The Twelve Tables mentions that those charged with sacrilege would be tried before the *quaestores parricidii,* responsible for trying capital offences. \\[4\\] By the late Republic capital punishment had been substituted for *interdictio aqua et igni*, or banishment where Romans could not offer them shelter, food or protection. \\[5\\] The point is that robbery of the *aerarium* was considered a very serious offence against the gods, and this alone, if not the strict punishment handed out to those who did try, deterred most robberies. \n\nAs for robberies- not many. I have already mentioned that time when Gracchus forced his way in, although that was under the authority of the Senate and he only did so because of a minor bureaucratic issue. In 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and entered Rome, his soldiers plundered the public treasury:\n\n&gt;Lucius Metellus, a tribune, opposed the proposition about the money, and when his efforts proved ineffectual went to the treasury and kept watch of its doors. The soldiers, paying little heed to either his guarding or his outspokenness, cut through the bar, for the consuls had the key, as if it were not possible for persons to use axes in place of it, and carried out all the money.\n\nNaturally, it's much easier to do so when your commander has full control of the city and you have weapons.",
