However, this same object could be made from boarskin, and we have several surviving examples of this, which we know come from a pig, because their bristly hair is still on the piece, allowing us to identify the animal of original! Now just as a cow can be turned into a saddle without hair, or a cow skin rug with hair, so too can a pig. The fact that we have surviving examples of pig skin with hair on it (albeit from a boar, though the domestic pig of the medieval period is much hairier and boar like than our modern variants, which raises the question of how wild that boar was) would indicate that the medieval people not only knew how to process pig skins into useful objects, but actively did so. We just don't have much indication of this because of how leather objects are curated and the fleeting nature of leather objects in general.  \n  \nAnd now for the \"call a food historian please\" section - iirc pig skin fried in its own fat is called cracklings in English and is delicious. I assume it existed in the medieval period, but a food historian should really weigh in here.

    "body": "As someone who studies medieval leather crafts I hate that I don't know more about this. However, as with all my answers, I will add the caveat that I am in many ways an expert generalist and will touch on a lot of connected areas surrounding the topic. I hope that those more niche experts may chime in and amend my answer as needed.\n\nFirst and foremost, leather is biodegradable and therefore many of the goods that were made from it have been lost. However, there are still some leather goods in collections that give us a good idea of the working and tanning techniques of the period in question. Unfortunately most museums when listing the materials an object is made from, will only state \"leather\" rather than what type of leather is used. There are of course exceptions to this, but they skew more towards the exotic side. For instance the British Museum has a set of crocodile skin Roman armor in their collection, which they note the animal used for; but for the leather mid 14th century vambrace (arm armor) - which is one of only a handful of surviving examples in the world and by far the most decorated, they only list the material as \"leather\".  \n  \nNow, we can make a few assumptions about how leather from animals in general was used in this period, as well as what leather was used for what, though this requires a bit of hands on experience and sleuthing. The properties of leather derive largely from two things - the animal it came from, and the tanning method. The second is what's really important to emphasize, because it can change something as simple as a cow skin into, among other things, leather that is good for armor, saddles, jackets, straps, machinery belts among other goods. These can all be produced from the same animal, but they all require post processing to achieve the desired characteristics. For instance, most armor and saddle leather is made using a process called veg tanning. However, most high end garment weight leather is also made using a variant of veg tanning. Despite this, the leather used for a jacket and the leather used for a saddle are fundamentally different in a variety of material ways, between how they stretch (or not) who they maintain a shape (or not) how they can be imprinted with designs (or not) what care they require, etc.\n\nWe do know that the vast majority of surviving leather goods from this period were veg tanned, which is a tanning process using vegetation derived tannins (citation needed - I only personally tried a animal fat tanning once in my college dorm room, do not recommend). This produces, as noted above, a material that is stretchy and can be formed when wet, but tends to shrink and hardened when dry. This makes it an excellent material for such things as scabbards, cases for objects, armor, and the soles of shoes. We also know that variants of this, as noted above, can be made into garment weight leather, though during this period the leather seems to have not had widespread use in garments with the exception of gloves which tended to be made from goat or lambskin (because of inherent differences in the animals skin) [Edit: below there are some extant 16th century garments linked so they definitely were used in garment construction earlier than i initially claimed]. The other particularly common tanning method which has unfortunately fallen out of production (much to the dismay of armourers everywhere) is called buff tanning. This is a tanning method using fish oils which produces a leather that is remarkably tough, soft, and very elastic. This makes it an excellent material for use in straps, belts, etc, as it can stretch to a shape and then return to its original shape without permanent deformation. To my knowledge there is only one tannery in England that still produces this, which is a shame because it is ubiquitous in extant armour harnesses for its properties. \n\nCont:",
