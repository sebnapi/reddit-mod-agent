If this information is absolutely vital for your work, consider asking for reading suggestions or other help in doing your own research. Alternatively, especially if this is a commercial project, consider hiring a historical consultant rather than relying on free labour here. While our flaired users may be happy to engage in such work, please note that this would need to be worked out privately with them, and that the moderation team cannot act as a broker for this.\r\n\r\n*Be respectful of the time that people put into answering your queries. In the past, we’ve noticed a tendency for writers and other creators to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the wider points they’re trying to make, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization.\r\n\r\nFor more general advice about doing research to inform a creative project, please check out [our Monday Methods post on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k8o4rv/monday\\_methods\\_researching\\_for\\_fiction/).",
