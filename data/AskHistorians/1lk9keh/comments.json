It is generally conjectured that the term \"Hungary\" (French \"Hongrie\", German \"Ungern\", Polish \"Węgry\", Old Czech \"Uhersko\") comes from \"Onogür\" denoting an ethnic macrogroup of the Ugro-Finnic peoples which name (on-ygür) literally means \"ten clans/families\" Magyars was relatively closely tied to. Later, when the Onogür alliance was destroyed by Khazars in mid-7th century, the name persisted and was used by southern scholars using chiefly Greek and Latin, eventually being applied to settlers of the Panonian valley (those living south of them were already known as Bulgars). This name was then disseminated across the Europe as apparently more people had contact with scholars and envoys using Greek and Latin rather than with actual Magyars speaking Hungarian, leading to the exonym prevalence over the endonym. This is a situation similar to Persia/Iran, where Iranians have been called their country \"Iran\" for millennia, but others were calling it \"Persia\" after the name of one province that became known due to its role in Ancient Greek history.",

Her final question was to recite the thirteenth amendment verbatim; since he didn&amp;#39;t know the exact wording, he bluffed by using the Pledge of Allegiance instead and she bought it and reluctantly allowed him to register.  I also have run across varying stories of long preparation and memorization sessions that occasionally succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind one other aspect: literacy tests came into being even prior to the Civil War in the North as an anti-immigrant measure sponsored by the Know-Nothings; Connecticut and Massachusetts enforced them on and off even before the South did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
